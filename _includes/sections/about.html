<h1><span data-i18n="skills.my_skills">About</span></h1>

<div>
    I am a Ph.D. student and researcher at the “U-Dub” (University of Washington) interested in the applications of statistical machine learning, natural language processing, and social sensing. Most of my research is under the supervision of the faculty at the Center For Statistics And The Social Sciences. I work under the guidance and advice of Professor Adrian Dobra. In addition, I am also working with Professor Yen-Chi Chen.

My research interests focused on solving social questions using natural language processing, statistical machine learning & data mining. Specifically, this can be boiled down into two interwoven areas. The first (1) area is machine learning and data mining, in which I pursue problems of forecasting and translation of information related to high-dimensional spatiotemporal data, such as cell phone, individual travel behaviors, and unstructured text data. Theoretically, I am interested in online and adaptive learning as well as geometric methods for machine learning.  The second (2) area is natural language processing. Mainly I am interested in conversational intelligence and NLU, which requires an understanding of multitask learning and memory network architectures. My research often focuses on leveraging individual and social behavioral patterns that shed light on how human interacts with human, place, and technology (such as artificial intelligence).  Together, I am passionate about bringing in social goods with the deliverables from my research.

Something I don’t claim expertise but have great interests: Robotics, Game Theory and (mostly) 19th century philosophy – the influential thinkers and great figures and their works, especially Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer, Mill and Bergson (I have a B.A. in Philosophy, anyway!) I love the poems of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and 苏轼.

Actively working with peers, I have interesting research discussions with my friend Castiel Zhuang, a promising young economist. Group work wise, I am a member of the Geometric Data Analysis Research Group starting Winter 2018, and the Working Group on Applied, Bayesian and Computational Statistics since Autumn 2016.

I code. I do statistics. I play drums with my band ‘Random Algorithms’. I shoot arrows with my recurve bow.  I hike a lot. I reached LEGENDARY level many times in Hearthstone, and I am a three-time Arena 12-winner. The photo above is outdated. For a more recent photo, please click here. My favorite composers at all time are Felix Mendelssohn, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, and Robert Schumann. My favorite pianists are Evgeny Kissin and Krystian Zimerman. What would I listen when I code?
